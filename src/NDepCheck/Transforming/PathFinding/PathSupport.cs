    /// Currently, NDepCheck does not have a concept of "paths". Rather, such information (e.g. to recognize
    /// and output cycles; or paths going from some item type to another) is encoded into marker on the
    /// dependencies. Each path is assumed to have its own marker; typically, such markers consist of
    /// a prefix and a runner count, e.g. "C0", "C1", ..., "C9", "C10", "C11", ..., for cycles.
    /// Only the dependencies of paths are marked (with one exception - see below), as follows:
    /// * All dependencies of a path with marker M contain a marker value for M greater than 0.
    /// * The order of the markers values designates the order of the dependencies on the path.
    /// * The final 4 bits of each path value are bits used for the following purposes:
    /// ** last bit (1 &lt;&lt; 0): 1 if the dependency is the first one on the path ("start")
    /// **          (1 &lt;&lt; 1): 1 if the dependency is the last one on the path ("end"); on a 
    ///                             path of length 1, both this and the last bit are set.
    /// **          (1 &lt;&lt; 2): 1 if the dependency or its UsedItem is matched by a count match
    /// **          (1 &lt;&lt; 3): 1 if the dependency is a loopback to some item that has occurred
    ///                             previously on the path. In this case, the second ("end") flag is
    ///                             also set.
